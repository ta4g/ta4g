// CostModel is the pricing engine to compute the final cost of a given order.
//
// There are multiple types of pricing model listed out in the type assertions below:
// 1. NoCostModel - there are no transaction_fee and no margin interest
// 2. StandardCostModel - the normal transaction_fee and margin interest apply
// 3. RampUpCostModel - the price to place open goes up with each request to BalanceChangeOnOpen,
//    and goes down on each request to BalanceChangeOnClose however it is a percentage change so it results in ever increasing costs.
//
