***Technical Analysis For Go***

Ta4g is an open source library for [technical analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis). 

It provides the basic components for creation, evaluation and execution of trading strategies.

This is a port of the popular technical analysis library [ta4j](https://github.com/ta4j/ta4j) from Java -> Golang.

**Why convert this library to Golang?**

1. Just for fun, I enjoy learning about new subjects and this is an area I'm not familiar with (yet).
1. I predominately write Golang CLIs, GRPC services, and other applications so using Golang over Java is my preference.
1. To contribute the open source community by converting one of the best libraries for technical analysis to enable more developers to leverage their good work.
