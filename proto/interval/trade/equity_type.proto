  // Cash for tracking the hard currency within an account,
  // this is the outstanding balance of fiat currency you can spend.
  //
  // When a "Portfolio" is created we allocate some amount of cash up-front.
  //
  // This is to give the Portfolio a concrete starting point and to make both
  // `CurrentPortfolio` and `ReturnOnCapital` much simpler to calculate later on.
  //
  // The amount of Cash you have also impacts the margin balance in your account.
  //
  // Regulation T Margin is the amount of `Cash` you need to set aside to guarantee your portfolio is stable.

  //
  // TL;DR: This is how much borrowing power the cash grants you when shorting or using option products.
  //
  // Similar to Cash this is added to the Portfolio when it is initially funded and is 1:1 with cash added to the account.
  // However unlike Cash this is not used in `CurrentPortfolio` and `ReturnOnCapital`,
  // it is merely used as a governor to limit how risky any Portfolio can be.
  //
  // Regulation T Margin Rules:
  // 1. Margin equity = Stock + (+/- cash balance)
  //
  // 2. Maintenance margin = 50% initial
  //
  // 3. 25% SRO requirements;
  //    Long equities = 25% requirement;
  //    Short equities = 30% requirement.
  //    *SRO - Self- Regulatory Organization -all securities and commodity exchanges in the United States
  //
  // 4. TD Ameritrade uses 30% minimum house maintenance requirement on long and short equities
  //
  // 5. Option requirements computed in real-time using FINRA rules and fixed percentages; please review Margin Handbook for details
  //
  // 6. Long options are not marginable and have 100% requirement
  //
  // For example:
  // 1. Fund Portfolio:
  //    - Add 30k Cash
  //    - Add 30k Margin
  // 2. BuyDirection 100x shares of stock at $10.00 per share, this costs `$1000.0` = `100 * $10.0`
  //    - Remove 1k Cash
  //    - Remove 0.3k Margin (rule 4, this is the max of rules 2-4)
  //    - Add 100x shares at cost-basis of $10.00
  // 3. SellDirection 100x shares of stock at $12.00 per share, this pays `$1200.0` = `100 * $12.0`
  //    - Remove 100x shares cost-basis of $10.00
  //    - Add 1.2k Cash
  //    - Add 0.5k Margin (0.3k from initial + 0.2k from profit)
  // 4. Net portfolio balance is:
  //    - 30.2k Cash
  //    - 30.2k Margin
